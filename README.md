# Observing time growth and finding the local maxima.

Observing the growth behavior by applying **_"the newton's method (1)"_** on compound and simple interest formulas as the time changes. We can also observe this behavior by applying **_"the area between two curves (2)"_** method. As a result we can define our **_Tmax value_** by getting the difference of both formulas**_(1)_**.

# Formulas:

1. δt = g(x)-f(x) ; where 0 <= x <=1.
2. ∫x−x2 dx. (x=1, x=0).
